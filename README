This is my personal stuff.

intented usage:

1) activate "github:MarcWeber"

2) after activating the plugin in your .vimrc call the Activate function:
  call vim_addon_MarcWeber#Activate('all')

  or pick a collections of plugins this way:
  call vim_addon_MarcWeber#Activate(['scala','vim'])

  if you want to do vim and scala development on this dev machine only.

Questions? Just ask.
